## Exercise I

a) O(n)

n = 3
a less than 3*3*3 27
0 + 9                   1
9 + 9                   2
18 + 9                  3
n=4
a less than 4*4*4 =64
0 + 16                  1
16 + 16                 2
32 + 16                 3
48 + 16                 4
time

b) O(log n)


c) I don't know if this is a trick question or just poorly worded. With regards to 'n' this has no runtime complexity because 'n' isn't used. But if you just mean 'n' as a placeholder just like bunnies is a placeholder then runtime complexity is O(n)
bunnies = 5
returns 2+bunnyEars(4)
    returns 2+bunnyEars(3)
      returns 2+bunnyEars(2)
        returns 2+bunnyEars(1)
          returns 2+bunnyEars(0)
returns 0
